# ACIS_showcase
Senior Project showcase. Only part of the image processing section of the project is shown.

The ACIS Project (Automated Check In Station) was designed and created to check in CPU chips. 
Multiple pictures are taken of the CPU, that are then stitched together forming a high resolution image.
This stitched image is then run through a data matrix finding program, and the result is decoded. 
The image is then saved in a time stamped folder that also contains an XML file with the decoded barcode. 

The starting images and the final results can be found in the Images folder.
